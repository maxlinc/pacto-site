		<h2>Consumers</h2>
		<p>Pacto helps you test consumers by both validating and stubbing services.  This helps you decouple tests to reduce test times and non-deterministic test failures without losing confidence in your test suite.  You can also design compatibility tests for similar consumers.</p>

		<h2>Providers</h2>
		<p>You can use Consumer-Driven Contracts to ensure you're providers are well tested without losing agility.  Pacto will test the provider implementation and make sure it complies with the same contract used to stub the service for consumers.</p>
